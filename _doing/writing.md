  <div class="doing-page-content">
    <p>I write when I have something worth saying—not on a fixed schedule, but when an idea has settled enough to put into words. The topics tend to sit at the intersection of what I’m building and what I’m thinking about: AI, systems, and the edges where science meets philosophy.</p>
    <p>Some of it is technical: notes on architectures, training, or tooling that I’ve found useful. Some of it is more reflective: time, consciousness, human emotion, and how we reason about systems—including ourselves—when we build machines that learn and act. I’m interested in the questions that don’t have a single right answer but are worth asking anyway.</p>
    <p>I publish on <a href="https://dev.to/bhuvanprakash" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dev.to</a> when it’s dev-focused, and I’ll link longer or more general pieces from here and from <a href="https://bhuvan.space" target="_blank" rel="noopener">bhuvan.space</a>. If you’re writing about similar themes—especially the messy boundary between technical work and bigger questions—I’d be glad to hear from you.</p>
