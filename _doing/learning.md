  <div class="doing-page-content">
    <p>I’m passionate about new things and genuinely curious—that curiosity is what led me to programming in the first place, and it’s why I’m still here. I don’t just want to use tools; I want to understand how they work and where they break. So a big part of what I’m doing is learning, all the time.</p>
    <p>Right now that means going deep on <strong>AI and machine learning</strong>: architectures, training pipelines, and how to make models that are not only capable but efficient. I work with PyTorch, scikit-learn, Keras, and mlflow, and I care about the full pipeline from data to deployment. I’m especially interested in energy-efficient learning and how we can get more out of less compute—that ties directly into the MIRAE work I’m doing.</p>
    <p>I’m also learning about <strong>quantum systems</strong> and the mathematical structures that underpin them. I don’t treat it as a separate world from “classical” software; I’m interested in where the two meet—simulations, photonic systems, and how we might build scalable prototypes that bridge theory and practice.</p>
    <p>On the engineering side I keep expanding the stack: TypeScript, Rust, Go, Kotlin, Dart, Flutter for different kinds of products; FastAPI, Django, React, Next.js for the web; AWS, Google Cloud, Firebase, Supabase when I need to move fast. I use Figma and design tools when I care about UX, and I’ve dabbled in things like OpenCV, Apache Spark, and GraphQL when the problem demanded it. The throughline is always: learn enough to build the thing, then learn more when the next thing demands it.</p>
    <p>I take notes as I go and share the useful bits when they’re ready—here on the site and sometimes on <a href="https://dev.to/bhuvanprakash" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dev.to</a>. If you’re on a similar learning path, especially in AI or quantum, I’d be glad to connect.</p>
