  <div class="doing-page-content">
    <p>I’m a self-taught developer and researcher based in India, and most of my work sits where AI, systems, and real-world impact meet. I care about building things that are not only interesting technically but useful—whether that’s a new architecture, a prototype, or a platform that others can build on.</p>
    <p>A big focus is the <strong>MIRAE series</strong>: an AI architecture I’m developing that’s centered on <strong>energy-efficient learning</strong>. Large models are powerful but costly; I’m interested in how we can get better performance per watt and per dollar—smarter training, better inductive biases, and architectures that learn more from less. MIRAE is the umbrella for that line of work, and I’m iterating on both theory and implementation.</p>
    <p>In parallel I’m working on a <strong>lightweight, scalable quantum computing prototype</strong> using photonic crystals. The goal isn’t to replace classical machines tomorrow; it’s to explore what’s possible when we bring quantum ideas into a practical, implementable form. I’m interested in how such a prototype could scale and what problems it might open up.</p>
    <p>I’m also building a <strong>fine-tuning platform</strong> inspired by Hugging Face—a place where teams can take base models and adapt them to their own data and tasks without reinventing the wheel. Making that process smooth, reproducible, and accessible is what I’m aiming for.</p>
    <p>Across all of this I’m interested in <strong>AI, quantum systems, and mathematical structure</strong>—and in the edges where science meets philosophy. If that overlaps with what you do, I’d love to connect.
