  <div class="doing-page-content">
    <p>I’m building an AI system for <strong>Trishul Space TVC</strong>—bringing machine learning and automation into their pipeline so the team can work faster and focus on the parts that need human judgment and creativity.</p>
    <p>TVC work often involves a mix of creative direction, technical constraints, and tight timelines. The goal of the AI layer is to handle the repetitive and time-consuming steps—whether that’s asset preparation, versioning, or certain kinds of analysis—so that people can spend more time on concept, story, and quality. I’m not trying to replace the creative process; I’m trying to make it easier to iterate and ship.</p>
    <p>That means thinking about what’s actually useful in their workflow: what’s painful today, what can be partially or fully automated, and how to integrate models and tools in a way that feels natural rather than bolted on. I care about reliability, clarity, and making sure the system is something the team can trust and extend.</p>
    <p>If you’re working on similar problems—AI for creative or production pipelines—I’d be interested to hear how you’re approaching it.
