    <p>I’m passionate about new things and curious by default—that curiosity is what led me to programming and to the kind of work I do now. A lot of that shows up as “exploring”: new tools, new papers, new ideas, and the places where different fields bump into each other.</p>
    <p>Some of it is concrete: new frameworks, libraries, and techniques in AI and systems. I keep an eye on what’s happening in PyTorch, in quantum and photonic computing, in open-source ML platforms, and in the broader dev ecosystem. I like to try things hands-on, not just read about them, so exploring often means a small prototype or a fork of someone else’s project to see how it behaves.</p>
    <p>But I’m also interested in the weirder, fuzzier questions: <strong>time</strong>, <strong>consciousness</strong>, and <strong>human emotion</strong>—and how they relate to the systems we build. When we train models that generate text or make decisions, we’re not just doing engineering; we’re touching questions that philosophy and cognitive science have wrestled with for a long time. I don’t claim to have answers, but I think the questions are worth holding in mind.</p>
    <p>I’m drawn to the edges where <strong>science meets philosophy</strong>: where rigorous models meet open-ended inquiry. That shows up in the kind of research I do (energy-efficient learning, quantum prototypes, fine-tuning) and in the kind of writing and reading I’m drawn to. I’ll share the best finds—papers, essays, projects—here and on my main site when it makes sense. If that resonates, say hi on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/bhuvanprakash/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">LinkedIn</a> or <a href="https://github.com/bhuvanprakash" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GitHub</a>.</p>
