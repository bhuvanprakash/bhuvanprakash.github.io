title: "What I'm focusing on in 2026"

description: "Fewer goals, more systems—and where I'm pointing my building and research this year."

I've never been great at “new year, new me” resolutions. What sticks for me is **systems**, not goals: the habits and setups that make the right thing the default. That’s partly why I keep coming back to books like *Atomic Habits* and *The Lean Startup*—small, repeatable loops beat one-off pushes.

So for 2026 I'm not listing a dozen objectives. I'm narrowing to three directions and trying to build systems around them.

**1. Energy-efficient ML (MIRAE)**  
Keep pushing on architectures and training methods that get more out of less compute and energy. I'll write and ship more of this in the open—here and on [GitHub](https://github.com/bhuvanprakash)—and tie it to real experiments, not just ideas.

**2. Fine-tuning platform**  
Turn the fine-tuning tooling I've been thinking about into something others can use. That means a clear path from “I have a base model and a dataset” to “I have a fine-tuned model I can evaluate and deploy.” More on that in a later post.

**3. Building a photonics GPU**  
This year I'm focusing on building a **photonics GPU**—using light instead of electrons for compute. It's early, but the goal is to get to a design that's testable and documentable. My [deep dive on photonics and MZI](/deep-dive/photonics-mzi/) will get updates as that progresses.

I'm based in India, building in the open, and always up for conversations with people working on similar problems. Here's to a year of fewer goals and more systems.
