    <p>Quantum computing doesn’t have to be done with superconducting qubits or trapped ions. You can encode quantum information in <strong>photons</strong>—particles of light—and process it with optical elements: beam splitters, phase shifters, and interferometers. Lasers provide a clean, controllable source of light, and integrated photonics lets you put many of these components on a chip. This deep dive is about why that’s interesting and how <strong>Mach–Zehnder interferometers (MZI)</strong> fit in as building blocks for photonic quantum computing.</p>

    <h2>Why photons?</h2>
    <p>Photons are fast, weakly coupled to their environment at optical wavelengths, and can be generated and detected with mature laser and detector technology. In a photonic quantum computer, qubits are often encoded in the presence or absence of a photon in a given mode (e.g. dual-rail encoding), or in other degrees of freedom like polarization or path. You then implement gates by sending photons through a network of linear optical elements (beam splitters, phase shifters) and sometimes nonlinear elements or measurements. Linear optical quantum computing (LOQC) shows that, in principle, universal quantum computation is possible with such setups, especially when combined with measurement and feed-forward.</p>

    <h2>Mach–Zehnder interferometer (MZI)</h2>
    <p>An <strong>MZI</strong> is a basic building block: a beam splitter splits a beam into two paths, each path can get a phase shift, then a second beam splitter recombines the beams. Depending on the phase difference, you get constructive or destructive interference at the outputs. In integrated photonics, MZIs are implemented as waveguides on a chip: the “beam splitters” are directional couplers or multimode interference (MMI) sections, and the phase shift is applied via thermo-optic or electro-optic tuning. A single MZI can implement a 2×2 unitary on two optical modes; chains of MZIs can implement larger unitaries and form the core of programmable photonic circuits used in quantum optics and quantum computing.</p>

    <h2>Laser’s role</h2>
    <p>Lasers give you a coherent, narrow-band source of light. For quantum applications you often need single photons or strongly squeezed states, which are typically generated by driving nonlinear crystals or other sources with a laser, then optionally filtering and routing the output. So the “quantum computer using laser” picture is: lasers pump the sources that produce the quantum states; those states then propagate through a network of MZIs and other elements that implement the quantum circuit; and single-photon detectors (or homodyne detection, etc.) read out the results. Scaling means integrating many such components—sources, MZIs, detectors—on a single photonic chip, which is an active area of research and matches the direction of my quantum prototype work (e.g. photonic crystals and scalable layouts).</p>

    <h2>Connection to what I’m building</h2>
    <p>I’m working on a lightweight, scalable quantum computing prototype that uses photonic structures (including photonic crystals). MZIs are a natural primitive for that: they’re well understood, implementable in integrated photonics, and compose into larger circuits. Understanding how to lay out MZI meshes, tune them, and interface them with lasers and detectors is part of making such a prototype practical. This page is a snapshot of that context; I’ll add more technical notes and references as the work evolves.</p>
