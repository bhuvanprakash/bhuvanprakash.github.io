    <p>Quantum computing aims to use quantum mechanics—superposition, entanglement, interference—to solve certain problems faster than classical computers. There are many ways to build a qubit: superconducting circuits, trapped ions, neutral atoms, spins in semiconductors, and <strong>photons</strong>. This deep dive is about <strong>quantum computing approaches that rely on lasers</strong>: lasers as pumps for single-photon or squeezed-light sources, laser cooling and trapping for ions or atoms, and laser-driven gates. It’s separate from the purely classical-photonics topic of <a href="{{ '/deep-dive/photonics-mzi/' | relative_url }}">Photonics and MZI</a>; here the focus is quantum information and computation.</p>

    <h2>Why lasers for quantum?</h2>
    <p>Lasers provide coherent, narrow-band, controllable light. In quantum systems they play several roles. <strong>Trapped ions</strong> and <strong>neutral atoms</strong> are cooled and manipulated by lasers; qubits are encoded in internal levels, and laser pulses implement gates. In <strong>photonic quantum computing</strong>, you often don’t put qubits “in” the laser—you use the laser to pump nonlinear processes (e.g. parametric down-conversion) that produce single photons or entangled pairs. Those photons are then sent through a network of beam splitters and phase shifters to run a quantum circuit. So the laser is the engine that creates the quantum resources; the computation happens in the optical network.</p>

    <h2>Photonic quantum computing in more detail</h2>
    <p>In linear optical quantum computing (LOQC), qubits are encoded in photons (e.g. presence/absence in a mode, or polarization). Single photons are generated by pumping a nonlinear crystal with a laser; the output is filtered and routed into a circuit of linear optical elements. Gates are implemented using interference and sometimes measurement and feed-forward. Scaling is hard because single-photon sources and detectors aren’t perfect, but the architecture is clean and compatible with integrated photonics. Research focuses on better sources, low-loss programmable circuits, and error correction.</p>

    <h2>Ions and atoms: laser cooling and gates</h2>
    <p>Trapped-ion and neutral-atom quantum computers use lasers for cooling (Doppler and resolved-sideband cooling), state preparation, and gate operations. Qubits are internal atomic levels; lasers drive transitions between them. Two-qubit gates can be mediated by shared motion (ions) or by Rydberg interactions (atoms). These platforms are mature for small-to-medium systems; scaling to many qubits requires more lasers, better control, and integration. So “quantum computing with lasers” here means: lasers are the primary tool for preparing and controlling the qubits, not just for pumping a separate photonic circuit.</p>

    <h2>Where I’m going with this</h2>
    <p>I’m interested in scalable quantum prototypes and in the interface between classical photonics (like MZI meshes) and quantum applications (sources, circuits, readout). Laser-driven systems—whether photonic, ion, or atom—are a major part of the landscape. This page is a focused deep dive on quantum computing with lasers; for the classical photonics side (MZI, integrated circuits), see <a href="{{ '/deep-dive/photonics-mzi/' | relative_url }}">Photonics and Mach–Zehnder interferometers</a>.</p>
